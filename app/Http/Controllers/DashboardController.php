         * The main purpose of this method is to display the standings and the matches already played.
         *
         * Both tables are filled with data depending of the tournament chosen
         *
         * A tournament is the combination of a competition and a season. Not all competition have all
         * seasons, so the seasons selector's available options depend of the competition selector
         * selected option. The competition selector is always filled with all competition, even if the
         * currently selected season has no related competition. The interface must handle this
         * particular case by sending a 404 response.
         *
         * Furthermore, the standings and the matches are sortable by any header in their HTML tables
         * The standings are sortable with two criteria. 'Points' is always the second criteria except
         * if he is the first one. In this case, the 'goals difference' is used as a secondary key.
         * By default, 'points' is the first criteria. For the matches, it's 'played_at'
         *
         * For user experience reasons, changing the sort order of one table can not change the sort
         * order of the other one.
         *
         * So, there is a 'state' defining the way the matches and the standings are retrieved.
         *
         * This state must include :
         *
         * - the competition identifier
         * - the season identifier
         * - the tournament is retrieved form these information or a 404 response is sent to the browser
         * - the teamsStats are the standings of the chosen tournament
         * - the matches are the matches of the chosen tournament
